%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
  Our project aims to remove a face mask over a person’s face, by reconstructing
  the covered part of the face. To have a more precise reconstruction of the
  missing parts (mouth and nose) behind the mask, we plan to use a second photo
  of the same person without the mask as a reference during the facial
  reconstruction process. There are no constraints on the quality of the
  reference photo, for instance the face can be taken from a different point of
  view than the first one. To sum up, given as input an image containing a
  person’s face partially covered by a medical mask and another photo of the
  same person without any occlusions, the output will be the first image with
  the mask-covered parts, mouth and nose, reconstructed. Future development
  could lead to generalizing the occlusion caused by the mask to any type of
  occlusion possible.

%%%%%%%%% BODY TEXT
\section{Image inpainting}

Image inpainting (a.k.a. image completion) is the task to fill a missing region
in an image by predicting the value of the missing pixels in order to have a
realistic image which is semantically close to the original one.
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Datasets}
GAN networks are data-hungry and needs a lot of diverse training examples in
order to generate quality images, for this reason we used the FFHQ 1024x1024
images, rescaled to 256x256, during training.  In other GAN inpainting
architectures, the mask region to reconstruct is usually calcuated during the
training in a randomized way.  We do not have this randomization process, so for
each image of FFHQ we precalculated the face region where the mask is weared
using facial landmarks.  For testing we used CelebA256.

\subsection{Architecture}
Our architecture is higly inspired by Free Form Image Inpainting with Gated
Convolution \cite{yu2019free} and DeepGIN \cite{li2020deepgin}.
